The history of computer science traces back to ancient machines like the abacus and includes figures like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Herman Hollerith, and others who contributed significantly.\n",

      "On page 2, it discusses the relationship between computer science and software engineering, touching on debates about whether computer science is a mathematical, scientific, or engineering discipline. It quotes Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, who considered computer science an empirical science akin to astronomy and geology. Proponents from different fields argue for its classification within mathematics, science, or engineering based on aspects like empirical testing, physical realization of mathematical entities, and reliability as in engineering.\n",
